### Optimization for Data Science

This course aims to understand as from a theoretical point of view than from a practical point of view the various optimization algorithm. In practice, the experience gained with this course is really relevant to understand the impact of hyperparameter and to develop a consistent search strategies for any Machine Learning models based on optimization. 

As most of the theoretical results in optimization are included in a convexity framework, all of the algorithm seen here are based on convex data. Still, the results and the observations seen in this context stand as strong guidelines for future uses of non-convex model.
